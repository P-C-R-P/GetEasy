Prepare a “readme” file that clearly explains what your project is about. If your project has a client and a server repo, start from one readme and then copy it over to the “sister” repo only modifying the needed sections. The client and server readme should cross-reference each other (i.e. the readme in one repo links to the other repo and vice-versa). If a legacy project already has a readme, just modify it as needed and update the “Contributors” section. In the end each readme should include the following sections (in this order):

    Project title, followed by a brief description (max 600 characters) and some screenshots (unless you built a library).
    Getting started, where you explain to someone who has never seen your project before how to install the required dependencies, set up the dev / production environment, and run it on their computer.
    Tech stack, highlighting the core technologies you used (e.g. framework, DB, and anything else that is interesting / relevant).
    Contributors (the team behind it, for group projects).
